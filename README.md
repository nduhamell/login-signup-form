Login and Register Form
====================================

A login and signup form using HTML, PHP, and MySQL. This form allows users to register and login. 
All information is stored in a MySQL database. After successful login the user is redirected to their dashboard.
This is a ReCaptcha Home Page that requires a user to verify they are real before redirecting to another link.
This is built to be implemented in a period of high DDOS/DOS to only let the real user through and protect your site!
